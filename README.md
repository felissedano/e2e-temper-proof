# Tamper Proof Data

The purpose of this repo is to explore the following two questions that came from certain interview questions:

**1. How does the client ensure that their data has not been tampered with?**
<br />
**2. If the data has been tampered with, how can the client recover the lost data?**


The proof of concept solution is written with TypeScript + React.
